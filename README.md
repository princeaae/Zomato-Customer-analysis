## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's dataset to uncover insights about customer behavior, restaurant preferences, and order patterns. The analysis aims to:
- Identify the types of restaurants that customers prefer.
- Understand ratings and votes received by various restaurant types.
- Compare online and offline order trends and customer satisfaction.
- Provide actionable recommendations for business growth.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes anonymized information on:
- **Restaurant Details**: Types, locations, and categories of restaurants.
- **Customer Feedback**: Ratings and votes received by restaurants.
- **Order Modes**: Online and offline transaction details.
- **Spending Patterns**: Average expenditure on orders.

**Dataset Details**:
- **Number of Restaurants**: Varies based on location and type.
- **Feedback Data**: Ratings and votes for each restaurant.
- **Transaction Data**: Includes mode, spending, and order count.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed missing values and duplicates.
   - Standardized data formats and cleaned irrelevant entries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed customer preferences by restaurant type.
   - Visualized ratings and votes distributions.
   - Studied correlations between spending, ratings, and order mode.

3. **Insights Generation**:
   - Answered key business questions (see below).
   - Identified trends and patterns for decision-making.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for detailed graphs and charts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis.
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration.
